                    <p>It was a college group project in which me and my team worked on the idea that how can we connect our Indian farmers to new technologies. There are several devices and tech which could be used for better production in less time and field area. In this project mainly we focused on a device 'Water Level Adjuster' which could reduce the extra workload and water wastage upto 90%. Secondly we researched about how vertical farming could be helpful in agriculture field. Our third and last presentation was on an application by which farmer may connect to cnsumer directly which will increase their profit and by the app they will also get the market updates, weather updates etc. We also created an UI based design that how our app will look. You can take a look on that...
